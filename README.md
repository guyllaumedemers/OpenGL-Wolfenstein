# OpenGL/SDL-Wolfenstein3D Remake

Welcome to Wolfenstein3D Remake, a group project made in the academic field using __CPlusPlus__, __OpenGL__ and __SDL__ API.</br>
Useful scripts are located in Assets/Scripts/..

## Getting Started

This repository has for objective of showcasing what could be achieve with a group of __three__ individuals under a week.
Some of the features presented here are obviously not mine and I won't take credit for them. __A detail list of the features I worked on will follow.__

## Content

```
NOTE : Scripts created by myself can be found here.
